ðŸ§  Face Detection Project
This project demonstrates a real-time face detection system using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks), combined with a Tkinter-based GUI for easy interaction. It leverages deep learning, image processing, and user-friendly interface tools to detect and display human faces from images or video streams.

âœ¨ Features
Real-time face detection using webcam or image files

GUI built using Tkinter for user-friendly operation

Face bounding boxes with detection confidence

Simple, modular, and extendable codebase

ðŸ“š Libraries Used
TensorFlow / Keras
For possible custom model usage or extensions

MTCNN
For accurate and pre-trained face detection

OpenCV (cv2)
For reading images, video feed, and image processing

Matplotlib
For visualizing images and detection results

Tkinter
To create the graphical user interface (GUI)
